The Morehouse Book Project was conceived in order to increase the intellectual stimuli on Morehouseâ€™s campus. Loosely based on the cult classic movie, Dead Poets Society, the Morehouse Book Project aims to circulate books amongst the student body, that will increase intellectual curiosity and fully embody a healthy education.
